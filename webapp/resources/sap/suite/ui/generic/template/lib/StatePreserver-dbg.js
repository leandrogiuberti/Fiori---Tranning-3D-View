	/* An instance of this class can be used to manage state information for a (template) component.
	 * In particular this includes adding state information to the current url such that it can be restored back later.
     * Moreover, this class supports a certain lifecycle model which can be used to determine how long a state should be preserved and to which instances it should be applied.
     * All in all this class provides two services which need to be combined:
     * 1. Store the current state of the component
     * 2. Restore a state which has been stored in step 1 according to the lifecycle information that has been attached to the state.
     *
     * Note that it is possible to define the lifecycle individually for parts of the state.
     * Thereby it is possible to attach state information to a binding path. This is used on OP to ensure that state information is invalidated when switching to another object.
     * This invalidation will not be done if lifecycle "page" or "pagination" has been set. In the second case the state will still be invalidated in case the user temporarily leaves the component (e.g. by closing the page and navigating back to LR).
     * The question whether two different binding paths still represent the same object (active and draft version of same object) is implemented by function getSameAsLastPromise().
     * Note that a given binding path will always be compared to the previous binding path which has been defined for the component.
     * There is a second aspect of life cycle which is not connected to the object which is currently displayed but to the lifecycle of the app itself.
     * The lifecycle of a state ends when the current FLP session ends unless lifecycle "permanent" is set. It even ends when the user leaves the app unless lifecycle "session" (or "permanent") is set.
     *
     * In order to ensure that the state is stored and managed accordingly the component needs to do three things:
     * a) Call public method stateChanged() of this class whenever the state has changed
     * b) Implement oSettings.getCurrentState() such that it returns the current state (with all necessary lifecycle information)
     * c) Provide a name for the "appState parameter". This will be a parameter that is added to the url. The value of this parameter will represent the state information that should survive the lifetime of the app.
     * If the lifecycle of the state exceeds the lifecycle of the app this class will use the CrossAppNavService to serialize the state information into an appStateKey. This appStateKey will be set as value for the appState parameter
     * in the url. This is done via oNavigationControllerProxy.navigateByExchangingQueryParam().
     *
     * In order to be able to ensure that the managed component always has the correct state, this class needs
     * - to be informed when the value of the appState parameter is changed in the url
     * - to be informed when the binding path for the component is changed
     * - to have a possibility to inform the component about a state change
     * For the first purpose this class exposes itself as StateChanger (method getAsStateChanger()). Thus method isStateChange() will be called whenever the url changes.
     * There are two scenarios in which this function is being called:
     * (i) The url change was triggered by the StatePreserver itself. In this case the StatePreserver will only update its internal book-keeping (function fnAdaptRealizedAppStateKey()). Moreover, it will return
     *     the information that no further processing of the url change is needed.
     * (ii) The url change was not initiated by the StatePreserver itself. In this case the appStateKey is taken from the url and stored in sAppStateKeyInUrl.
     *      Moreover, it is expected that later on method applyAppState() will be called which also serves the second purpose (provide the binding path).
     *      applyAppState() will then create the target state for the component out of the provided information (thereby deserializing the state information contained in the appStateKey by using the CrossAppNavService)
     *      and pass it to oSettings.applyState() which is provided by the component in order to fulfill the third purpose.
     *
     * Note that both services (storing resp. restoring of state) provided by this class are implemented asynchronously. This is a consequence of the  asynchronity of the CrossAppNavService, of the function that determines whether
     * two binding paths should be considered to represent the same object, and the processing of url changes.
     * Therefore, it can theoretically happen that the class is called to provide one service while it is still working on another one. This is potentially causing conflicts, since the component can only have one well-defined state
     *  and the appStateKey in the url is considered to be unique. Moreover, the information encoded in the url and the state of the component should be aligned.

	 * - oComponent: The owning component

	 * - getCurrentState: a function returning the current state of the page.
	 *   The return value should be a map that maps keys (describing different aspects of the state) onto objects containing two properties:
	 *   # data: The data containing the state
	 *   # lifecycle: An object describing the lifecycle of the state
	 *     The following properties of this lifecycle object are evaluated:
	 *     % permanent: if this is set to true a hash that represents the state is stored within the url.
	 *                  The information how to resolve the hash back to a state is persisted (if the system settings allow this persistence)
	 *     % session: if this is set to true the a hash that represents the state is stored within the url.
	 *                The information how to resolve the hash back to the state is kept in the session
	 *     % pagination: if this is set to true the state information will be preserved on object change provided this change is done via pagination
	 *                   (pagination = object change while the corresponding view stays visible)
	 *     % page: if this is set to true the state information will be preserved for the page for the lifetime of the app (unless it is replaced by another state)
	 * - getInitialState: a function that returns a state that is considered as the unconfigured state of this page
	 * - applyState: a function(oState) that applies the state (a map of keys to data) onto the page

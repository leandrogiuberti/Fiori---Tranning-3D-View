When linked to a parameterized entity set, the filter bar automatically adds fields for required parameters.
A parameterized entity set has specific parameters to tailor the data it delivers,
making it valuable for complex data retrieval involving complex queries or calculations based on different input values.

In this sample's service definition, "Customers" with a "Total Spend" that is stored in "US Dollar (USD)"
are linked to the parameterized entity set "CustomerParameters", using the pseudo key "PreferredCurrency".
The filter bar, now linked to the parameterized entity set as well, automatically includes a field for the required parameter "Preferred Currency".
The backend will use this input to convert the "Total Spend" to your specified preferred currency.

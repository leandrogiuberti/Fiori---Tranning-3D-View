This means that {template} identifies the template to be extended, e.g. <code>sap.suite.ui.generic.template.ObjectPage.view.Details</code> for the standard object page. Property <i>controllerName</i> of the manifest entry specifies the controller extension to be used. Even if the same template is used more than once, this single controller extension will be instantiated once for each page based on this template. As a consequence, the extension code for all these pages needs to be collected in one controller extension, which results in code that is difficult to maintain. </br> <code>registerControllerExtensions</code> provides a tool to distribute the extension code according to pages they are actually used on. </br> To use this tool, you should create separate classes implementing the logic for each single page. </br> All event handlers and formatters used in the view extensions of the corrsponding page should be defined as public instance methods of this class. The same applies to all extension functions that should be overridden by extension code. Each of these classes can contain an optional method <code>onInit(oController)</code>. </br> This method can be used to initialize the class as usual.

This was caused by the way the old API of SFB (getDataSuiteFormat and setDataSuiteFormat) worked: the get method returned only select options for the filters that actually had values (i.e. no select option for the filters the user removed the values from), and the set method only overrode those values, select options were provided for (i.e. the missing ones just kept their default value set during initialization). To overcome this problem, the extension was created to inform Fiori elements about all fields potentially running into that problem, and we added a select option (I EQ \"\") for those fields. This workaround of course ahs two severe problems: A filter with eq \"\" is not the same as not having a filter for the same field (rather the opposite), and all applications were required to keep extension and annotations in sync (and missing to do that would only be found in very exceptional cases). With the newer API of SFB (getUiState and setUiState), this problem has been overcome (esp. as setUiState overrides all filters, not only the ones provided).)"}],"methods":[{"name":"adaptNavigationParameterExtension","visibility":"protected","static":true,"parameters":[{"name":"oSelectionVariant","type":"sap.fe.navigation.SelectionVariant","optional":false,"description":"Selection variant object containing the information which needs to be passed to the target application"},{"name":"oObjectInfo","type":"object","optional":false,"parameterProperties":{"semanticObject":{"name":"semanticObject","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Semantic object used for the intend based navigation"},"action":{"name":"action","type":"string","optional":false,"description":"Action on the context for which the navigation is triggered"}},"description":"Context object based on which the intent based navigation is triggered"}],"description":"This method is called by SAP Fiori elements before triggering an external navigation.

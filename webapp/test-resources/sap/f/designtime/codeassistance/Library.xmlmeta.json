If there is not enough room for all action items, the action bar can be swiped to access the rest of the action items.\n\n<h3>Resizing<\/h3>\n\nResizing functionality only affects desktop or tablet devices.\n\nBy setting the <code>sidePanelResizable<\/code> property, the expanded side panel can be resized by mouse (by drag or by double click on resize splitter), by keyboard or by choosing one of three predefined positions in the side panel's context menu (min, max and default widths)\n\n<h3>Keyboard shortcuts<\/h3>\n\n<ul> <li>[Shift] + [Command] + [p] (Mac) / [Shift] + [Control] + [p] (Windows) - Expand/Collapse side panel<\/li> <li>[Arrow Up], [Arrow Down] - Move to the next or previous action item<\/li> <li>[Enter], [Space] - Choose the selected action item<\/li> <li>[Command] + [Arrow Left] (Mac) / [Control] + [Arrow Left] (Windows) / [Tab]- Move from action items to the opened side content panel<\/li> <li>[Command] + [Arrow Right] (Mac) / [Control] + [Arrow Right] (Windows) / [Shift] + [Tab]- Move from opened side content panel to the action items<\/li> <li>[F6] / [Shift] + [F6] - Navigate back and forth between main content, side panel and side content groups <li>[Esc] - Close the opened side content panel and set focus back to main content<\/li> <\/ul>\n\nIf the side panel's <code>sidePanelResizable<\/code> property is set, there is an action item chosen, and the resize splitter is focused:\n\n<ul> <li>[Home] - set the expanded side panel width to the minimum value defined in <code>sidePanelMinWidth<\/code> property<\/li> <li>[End] - set the expanded side panel width to the maximum value defined in <code>sidePanelMaxWidth<\/code> property<\/li> <li>[Enter] - set the expanded side panel width to the default value defined in <code>sidePanelWidth<\/code> property<\/li> <li>[Shift]+[F10] or [Context menu] - show the resize context menu<\/li> <li>[Arrow Left] or [Arrow Up] / [Arrow Right] or [Arrow Down] - increase/decrease the width of the expanded side panel with the regular step<\/li> <li>[Shift] + [Arrow Left] or [Shift] + [Arrow Up] / [Shift] + [Arrow Right] or [Shift] + [Arrow Down] - increase/decrease the width of the expanded side panel with the larger step<\/li> <\/ul>","DeprecatedInfo":{"isDeprecated":false},"aggregations":{"layoutData":{"method":"#getLayoutData,destroyLayoutData,setLayoutData","Deprecated":false,"Experimental":false,"multiple":"false","description":"Defines the layout constraints for this control when it is used inside a Layout.
